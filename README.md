# CoffeeRun
## Tableau Visualizations on Coffee Runs
In this project we will be doing some visualizations to plot where Starbucks locations are most concentrated in and what state have none or few Starbucks.
## Questions we will answer
1. What State has the most locations?
2. Is there a state with no Starbucks?
3. If we had to be dropped from space and can choose to land in one city in the US, what is the likleyhood that we would find a Starbucks quickly based on the number Starbucks in that city.
